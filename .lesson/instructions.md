# Unit D2 Lesson 2:   

In this lesson you will create a Constructor method for the Class/object you created in Lesson 1, and use it to create your objects.
## Instructions
* Copy the code from the class you created in Lesson 1 to your Lesson 2 repl.
* Create a Constructor Method for the class that allows you to enter all the properties of a new object. For example, if your object class has two properties, you will use two parameters for the constructor.
* Create three objects using your object class using the constructor method you created. Show the properties of the objects thus created.
